# Recycle Rampage

In Recyle Rampage is a tower defence game in which you're tasked with defending humanities last operational recycle plant against the tide of unrelenting garbage monsters! 

Recyle Rampage is made by Rob Verhoef in Unity using C#. 

Recycle Rampage was part of the Tower Defence assignment, which took place in my second year of studying Game Development at Mediacollege Amsterdam.
